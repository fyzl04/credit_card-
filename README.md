## 1. Overview of Problem Statement

Effectively managing customer complaints in the financial industry is crucial for customer satisfaction and retention. This project leverages machine learning to predict key outcomes related to credit card complaints, including:
- The likelihood of a consumer disputing a case.
- Timeliness of company responses.
- The impact of sentiment in complaint narratives on resolution outcomes.

---

## 2. Objective

Develop machine learning models to:
1. Predict whether a consumer is likely to dispute a case.
2. Classify if the company will provide a timely response.
3. Analyze the influence of complaint narrative sentiment on resolution success.

## 3. Data Description

- **Source**: (https://data.world/dataquest/bank-and-credit-card-complaints)  
- **Dataset Size**: 33.6 MB 
- **Key Features**:
  - `Date received`: The date the complaint was received.
  - `Product`: The type of product associated with the complaint (e.g., credit card, loan).
  - `Issue`: The specific issue raised by the consumer.
  - `Consumer complaint narrative`: Textual narrative describing the complaint.
  - `Company response to consumer`: The company's resolution action.
  - `Timely response?`: Whether the company responded in a timely manner (Yes/No).
  - `Consumer disputed?`: Whether the consumer disputed the resolution (Yes/No).

## 4. Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Import the dataset from the specified source.
- Conduct initial inspections to understand the data structure and missing values.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Detect and address outliers using statistical methods such as Z-score and IQR.
- Transform skewed data in numerical features.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of key features using:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Heatmap Correlations
  - Pair Plots
  - Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
  - Line Plots for temporal trends
- Identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Generate new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., interaction features, sentiment scores).

### 5. Feature Selection
- Use algorithms like Random Forest and SelectKBest to identify important features.
- Remove irrelevant or redundant features to improve model efficiency.

### 6. Model Building
Implement the following machine learning models for classification and regression:

#### Classification Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost)

#### Regression Models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor

### 7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics:

#### Classification Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve and AUC

#### Regression Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R\u00b2) Score

### 8. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize model performance using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

### 9. Save the Model
- Save the trained models using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle` for future use.

### 10. Test with Unseen Data
- Test the trained models on unseen datasets to evaluate their robustness and generalizability.

### 11. Interpretation of Results
- Summarize model performance and key insights.
- Highlight the most influential features and their business implications.

### 12. Future Work
- Explore deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for text analysis.
- Periodically update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
- Address imbalanced data issues using resampling techniques.
- Incorporate additional features to enhance predictive power.
